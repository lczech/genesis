/**
 * @brief Find clades of the tree that are monophyletic with respect to the given list of nodes,
 * that is, clades that only contain nodes from that list. Return all edge indices of those clades.
 *
 * The function takes a set of leaf nodes, and selects all branches of the tree that belong to
 * monophyletic clades containing only leaf nodes from the given set:
 *
 * ![Three different sets of nodes and the resulting clades.](tree/monophyletic_subtrees.png)
 *
 * In the example, the function was called three times with three different sets of nodes.
 * In each case, all branches are selected/colorized that are monophyletic with respect to the
 * nodes.
 * In other words, the function conceptually iterates all edges of the tree.
 * If one side of the split induced by an edge only contains leaf nodes from the given set,
 * the whole clade is monophyletic with respect to that set, and hence added to the resulting
 * list of edges.
 *
 * If @p include_splitting_edge is `true` (default), the edges that separate each clade from the
 * rest of the tree are also included. This is particularly important for edges leading to a
 * leaf/tip of the tree: If set to `false`, those edges are not included, meaning that
 * the respective node does not contribute to the result at all.
 *
 * In order to solve/refine this, that is to *not* include the splitting edge of larger clades,
 * but still include an edge that leads to a single leaf node (if this node is not part of any
 * larger clade), the additional parameter @p include_leaf_edges can be used.
 * It also defaults to `true`, meaning that those edges are included by default.
