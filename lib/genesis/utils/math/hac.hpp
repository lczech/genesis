/**
 * @brief Generic class for computing a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC).
 *
 * The class provides the basic clustering mechanism, i.e., iteratively finding the closest two
 * clusters, and merge them. By design, in order to allow for greater flexibility, it however
 * does not directly include typical aspects such as the linkage function for obtaining a distance
 * between clusters. Instead, we here assume that our observations of type `T` are merged in each
 * step into a new instance of `T` representing the two original clusters, and that the distance
 * function operates on this type `T` directly.
 *
 * Thus, a typical HAC can be implemented by using `T = std::vector<U>` of the desired underlying
 * type `U` of observations, setting the merge function to move elements from the two original
 * clusters (or copy, if they are still needed) to the new one, and setting the distance function
 * to use the desired linkage function on these vectors. See hac_with_linkage() and
 * hac_with_distance_matrix() for helper functions to set up a clustering for these use cases.
 *
 * The design hence also allows variants of HAC where we can naturally merge observations into
 * clusters, such as bitvectors, where the distance can be the Jaccard similarity between them,
 * and the merge operation computes their union. On that data type, this might be more natural,
 * as we are only ever operating on single bitvectors, and no linkage is needed in the distance
 * computation.
 *
 * To set up and run the clustering, at least the distance_function and merge_function have to
 * be provided, as well as the set_data() function to be used to set the intial data per cluster.
 *
 * An important consideration is whether the distance calculation is meant to be ultrametric,
 * such as when using this class to implement UPGMA. For the resulting dendrogram, by default,
 * we compute branch lengths as the distance between parent and child nodes, by simply applying
 * the distance function between them. However, to achieve an ultrametric dendrogram, we then also
 * need to subtract the branch lengths that are already implicitly captures in the sub-clusters.
 * See ultrametric_branch_lenghts() for details.
 *
 * Note that we always build a bifurcating histogram. That is, if there are multiple pairs of
 * clusters with the same distance between them, we pick only the first one to merge.

     * branch lengths. That is, if clusters A and B are merged into a new cluster P in an iteration
     * of the algorithm, we compute the two resulting branches from P to A and B by applying the
     * distance function to both pairs of clusters.
     *
     * However, for instance when computing UPGMA, the resulting branch lengths are then overestimated,
     * as the distances between P and A/B are the overall distances, and do not account for the
     * distances within A and B respectively towards their original observations. See
     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPGMA for an example. Hence, when activating this option here,
     * the branch lengths within the original clusters A/B are subtracted from the ones towards P,
     * such that the resulting dendrogram is ultrametric. For instance, the distance from P to A is
     * then computed by applying the distance function as before, but then subtracting the distance
     * from A to its leaves from that.
     *
     * This requires that the distance function is monotonic: When merging two clusters, the
     * resulting distance between them can never be smaller than the distances within these clusters
     * (from their parent to their leaves - all of them are equal in this case, as we assume
     * ultrametricity to begin with). If this is not the case, we would get a negative distance
     * from P to A or B, in which case the computation here will throw an exception.
