/**
 * @brief Wrapper around `std::future` that implements (pro-)active waiting, i.e., work stealing.
 *
 * This has the same interface and functionality as `std::future`, with the key difference that
 * when calling wait(), tasks from the ThreadPool queue are processed while waiting. This avoids
 * the pool to deadlock should tasks submit tasks of their own that they are then waiting for.
 * In such a scenario, all threads in the pool could be waiting for their submitted tasks, but none
 * of them can run, because all the threads are already processing a task (the one that is stuck
 * waiting).
 *
 * The technique is inspired by "C++ Concurrency in Action" * book by Anthony Williams, second
 * edition, chapter 9, where this idea is mentioned as a way to avoid starving tasks. We here wrap
 * this idea into a class, so that users of the ThreadPool have to use this feature, and hence
 * avoid the deadlock.

/**
 * @brief Thread pool for distributed work.
 *
 * This simple implementation offer a standing pool of worker threads that pick up tasks.
 *
 * For reasons explained below, it is recommended to initialize a global thread pool via
 * Options::get().global_thread_pool(), with one fewer threads than intended to maximally use,
 * as the main thread will also be able to do work while waiting for tasks via our work-stealing
 * ProactiveFuture. Use guess_number_of_threads() for obtaining the adequate number of total threads
 * to run, and subtract one to get the number to use this class with.
 *
 * Example
 *
 *     // Create a thread pool with 3 worker threads, on a 4 core system.
 *     ThreadPool thread_pool( 3 );
 *
 *     // Enqueue a new task by providing a function and its arguments, and store its future result.
 *     // This is a ProactiveFuture, so that calling wait() or get() on it will process other tasks.
 *     auto result = thread_pool.enqueue_and_retrieve(
 *         []( int some_param ) {
 *             // do computations
 *             int some_result = 42;
 *             return some_result;
 *         },
 *         0 // value for `some_param`
 *     );
 *
 *     // Get the value of `some_result` from the future.
 *     // As this is a future, the function call to get() blocks until a thread has finished the
 *     // work, but also processes other tasks from the queue in the meantime, see ProactiveFuture.
 *     std::cout << result.get() << "\n";
 *
 * As the workers are stored in the ThreadPool object itself, it does not allow to be copied.
 *
 * The pool implements a work stealing technique similar to the one described in the
 * "C++ Concurrency in Action" book by Anthony Williams, second edition, chapter 9, in order to
 * avoid dead-locking when tasks submit their own tasks. In such cases, the parent task could then
 * potentially be waiting for the child, but the child might never start, as all threads in the pool
 * are busy waiting for the children they enqueued. Hence, our wrapper implementation, called
 * ProactiveFuture (a thin wrapper around `std::future`; see there for details), instead processes
 * tasks from the queue while waiting for the future, so that those do not starve.
 *
 * This mechanism also allows to start a ThreadPool with 0 threads. In that case, all tasks will
 * be processed once wait() or get() is called on their returned ProactiveFuture - essentially
 * making the pool behave as a lazy evaluator of the tasks. This is very convenient behavior to
 * ensure that the number of actually busy threads is exactly known - a main thread that waits for
 * some submitted tasks will also be doing work while waiting. Hence, we recommend to start this
 * pool with one fewer threads than hardware concurrency (or whatever other upper limit you want
 * to ensure, e.g., Slurm).
 *
 * Alternatively, tasks can also be enqueued using enqueue_detached(), which does not return a
 * ProactiveFuture to wait for, and instead runs the task without any return. This is for instance
 * useful for tasks whose result we do not need. Moreover, this mechanism can be used to enqueue
 * a long series of tasks without waiting for each individually, and only finally calling
 * wait_for_all_pending_tasks() from the main thread to ensure that all work is done. This mechanism
 * is faster, as it does not have any overhead for creating and managing the
 * `std::future`/ProactiveFuture instance. However, it is then recommended to limit the maximum
 * size of the task queue, as explained next.
 *
 * Lastly, if upon construction a maximum queue size is provided, only that many tasks will be
 * queued at a time (with a bit of leeway, due to concurrency). If a thread calls enqueue_and_retrieve()
 * or enqueue_detached() when the queue is already filled with waiting tasks up to the maximum size,
 * the caller instead waits for the queue to be below the specified max, and while waiting, starts
 * processing tasks of its own, so that the waiting time is spend productively.
 *
 * This is meant as a mechanism to allow a main thread to just keep queueing work without capturing
 * the futures and waiting for them, while avoiding to endlessly queue new tasks, with the workers
 * not being able to catch up. The max size needs to be at least double the number of threads for
 * this to make sense. Due to concurrency, the max size can be exceeded by the number of threads,
 * in case that many threads enqueue work simultaneously. That is okay, as we usually just want
 * there to be _some_ upper limit on the number of tasks. Also, in case of just a single main thread
 * that is enqueueing new tasks, the maximum is never exceeded.
 *
 * When using this mechanism of submitting work without storing the futures, use the
 * wait_for_all_pending_tasks() function of the class to wait for all current work to be done.
 * This is intended to be called, for instance, from the main thread, once there is no more work
 * to be enqueued.
